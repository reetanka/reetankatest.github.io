## Welcome to Pages Built by RJ

Welcome to My first built website. I am a noob in this built though I have already have expirience of building websites uding Wordpress. But Github is totally new to me.
You can [connect with me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reetanka-jana/). I have given my Linkedin profile here.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
Specifically this site is built using Jekyll which transforms plane texts into Blogs and static websites.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/reetanka/reetankatest.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
